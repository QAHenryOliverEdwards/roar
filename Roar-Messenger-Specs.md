### Introduction

The purpose of this document is to outline the group project specification that we will be working on during our bench time at QA.

This project will encapsulate the concepts from all core training modules in addition to leveraging new technologies not previously learned at QA.

### Objectives

The overall objective of the project is the following:

```
To build and provide a full test suite for a full-stack Web application
suitable for a given client specification - with utilisation of supporting
tools, methodoligies and technologies that encapsulate all modules covered
during traning as well as new techologies not previously covered.
```

Specifically we are required to create a new web appication according to our (fictional) client's specification:

* Our client wants a platform for social messaging 
* Our team has been tasked with creating a website which should present information about users, and messages.
* There are various features which the client has requested; some are 'essential' while others are 'desirable'.
* Our client has insisted that a full test suite for the application must be implemented, covering the following key ares:
    * **Unit Testing** of the back-end
    * **Integration Testing** of the back-end
    * **User-Acceptance Testing** of the front-end
    * A **Non-Function Testing** suite
    * A **Functional Testing** suite
* Our client does not have a hard deadline. We have time for:
    * A **sprint zero**
    * **An unknown number of sprints** to be undertaken while on the bench

### Scope

The scope of the project is as follows:

* The team must demonstrate a full commitment to an Agile approach throughout the project, include **stand-up meetings**.
* Our client requests that the codebae is **fully integrated into a central repository**.
* The team is required to utilise the **feature-branch model**.
* It is recommended that the team regularly builds **project releases**.
* Our client requires a paper-trail, and therefore expcts to see a **project management**

### Deliverables
The final deliverable for this project is an applicaiton that has a front-end, this front-end should be able send and recieve requests, this should front-end should use a nice stylesheet (e.g. bootstrap) and take advantage of JavaScript frameworks (e.g. react). The back-end should be able to handle these requests, query the database and return the suitable result, the back-end should use a suite-able server technology such as Spring Boot. 

### Client Requirements
